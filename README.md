## The Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a **time management method** developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's a productivity technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### The basic steps of the Pomodoro Technique are:
1. Choose a task that you want to work on.
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes (this time interval is called a "pomodoro").
3. Work on the task until the timer rings.
4. Take a short break (usually 5 minutes).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for four "pomodoros" in a row.
6. After completing four pomodoros, take a longer break (usually 15-30 minutes).

The idea behind the technique is that by breaking your work into manageable 25-minute intervals, you can stay focused and productive without getting burnt out. The short breaks between each pomodoro can also help you to stay fresh and avoid fatigue.

The technique has been widely adopted and has many variations, including the use of longer or shorter intervals, and the incorporation of specific activities during breaks (such as stretching or meditation).
